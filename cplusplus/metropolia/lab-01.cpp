/*
Write a program that first asks from the user how many numbers he needs. After that the program allocates
memory space to store those numbers (integer array). Next the program fills the array with random numbers
between 0 - 99, and the program displays all numbers from the array. After that the program calculates the
mean of the generated number calling a separate function, int mean(int *array, int n). Finally, the program
must free the memory space it allocated. There is rand() function for generating random numbers. Limiting
the range to [0,99] is done with rand() % 100. In order to use rand() function you must include cstdlib header.
