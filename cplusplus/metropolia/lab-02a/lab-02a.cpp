/*
Develop the xmltemperature_pohja.cpp program further so that it finds and extracts specified items from the xml-string using start
and end tags. Now we find and extract and display first the location information and then the temperature
information. Location can be found between the tags <location> and </location>. The temperature is between
the tags <temp_c> and </temp_c>.

To make it easy to find whatever information from the xml-string write a function that takes the xml-string
and the "inner" text (same for start tag and end tag) of the tags as parameters and returns the text from
between the start tag and end tags. If either start or end tag is not found the function must return "not found".
Note that when you search for the tag you must search for the whole tag (including angle brackets) not just the
tag name that was given as parameter.

For example, if you wanted to find the location information you could call it as follows:
    location = find_field(page, "location");

and to get the temperature you could call it as follows:
    temperature = find_field(page, "temp_c");
